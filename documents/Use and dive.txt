Use and dive.   
=============   
  
I'm writing this file inside the text editor I'm building.

I'm writing this file and it is part of the process of writing this software.

I'm writing this file to explain my thinking, to myself and to you too, reader.

  
I'm writing this software, and it is also part of a larger journey that I called "Creative coding: Information Pipeline".  
  
It's an humble attempt (automatic corrector just offered to swap 'humb' for 'dumb', thanks) at discovery through making, experimenting.

It's also an attempt at being more intentional in my daily practice and more generally in everyday life. My aim is to be more efficient writing both prose and code.

I would like to able to structure thoughts more directly and (re) use previously saved elements of thoughts.

To use these elements more efficiently, I proposed myself to write the tool to write and think better: a sort of automated mind mapping/sorting.  
  
This evolving tool is for now exclusively based on hashtags (at the time of writing). In the future, it could incorporate different ways to organise and browse the archives.   
  
Some ideas:

- visual mind map, with connections
- links across documents
- folders and collections
- versionning
- - operators : inserting actions, notes and metadata in the flow of text, the train of thoughts  
      
    I like the simplicity of the setup. If I'm honest this is extremely sub-optimal in terms of data management, interface states, the tech stack I'm using, etc. But it's also radically simple and can be understood with little basic knowledge of the underlying code.   
    It hopefully can also be easily extended and build-upon.
